Intern Name: Vishal Ramkumar Rajbhar

Intern ID: CV/A1/18203

Domain: Data Science

Program: Code Veda Intermediate Internship

📝 Task Overview
The objective of this task is to build and evaluate classification models for predicting categorical outcomes. Using the classic Iris dataset, the project implements Logistic Regression with a One-vs-Rest strategy to classify flower species. The performance of this model is then compared with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

🎯 Objectives
Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.

Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Train a Logistic Regression model for multi-class classification using the One-vs-Rest approach.

Implement and compare results with:

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluate models using standard classification metrics.

Visualize model performance using ROC curves for each class.

📁 Dataset
Name: Iris Dataset

Source: sklearn.datasets

Target: Predict the species of Iris flowers — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica

🧪 Models Implemented
Logistic Regression (One-vs-Rest Classification)

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy Score – Overall correctness of the model

Precision Score (Macro-average) – Measure of relevancy of positive predictions

Recall Score (Macro-average) – Measure of model’s ability to find all positive samples

ROC AUC Score (Macro-average) – Assesses model’s ability to distinguish between classes in multi-class settings
